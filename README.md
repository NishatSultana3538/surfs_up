# Surfs_up


## Overview of the Surfs_up; retreive precipitation data: 
W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.

You know that you can set W. Avy's mind at ease by analyzing precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf. You have the last 12 months of precipitation data already loaded into your SQLite database, so you are ready to go.

W. Avy supplied you with the data he wants us to use and has asked you to look at a full year of data. When deciding how to parse the data, you remember that his favorite day is August 23, 2017 because it's the anniversary of the first time he ever went surfing and had ice cream on the same day. 

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
